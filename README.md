# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Binance Order Book Logger (C++)

This project connects to the Binance WebSocket API and logs real-time order book data (depth updates) for a selected trading pair (e.g., `BTC/USDT`). It computes the **order book imbalance** and logs it to a CSV file for further analysis and backtesting.

---

## Features

- Connects to Binance WebSocket using `Boost.Beast` (SSL over WebSocket)
- Parses real-time order book depth updates
- Computes **order book imbalance** (bid vs ask volume)
- Logs timestamped data into a CSV file
- Modular C++17 codebase with `OrderBook`, `CSVWriter`, and `WebSocketClient`
- Cross-platform (macOS & Linux)
